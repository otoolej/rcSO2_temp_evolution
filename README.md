# Code to accompany paper "Monitoring cerebral oxygenation of preterm infants using a neonatal specific sensor"


Matlab and R code used to in:

`Kenosi M, Oâ€™ Toole JM, Hawkes GA, Hutch W, Low E, Wall M, Boylan GB, Ryan CA, Dempsey EM,
Monitoring cerebral oxygenation of preterm infants using a neonatal specific sensor,
Journal of Perinatology, 2018, 38(3):264.` [10.1038/s41372-017-0007-5](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41372-017-0007-5)

Code only. No data.

Please cite the above reference if using this code to generate new results. 

# Mixed-effects model

The mixed-effects model is developed in _R_ (version
3.3.1, [The R Foundation of Statistical Computing](http://www.r-project.org)) using the
_lme4_ package (version 1.1-10). Script [gen\.MixedEffectsModel\.R](gen.MixedEffectsModel.R)
details model selection and estimation of fixed coefficients.


# Hypoxia and hyperoxia measures for rcSO<sub>2</sub> 

We define hypoxia as the total area <55/60% rcSO<sub>2</sub> and hyperoxia as the total
area >85/90% rcSO<sub>2</sub>, using the lower limits (i.e. 55% and 85%) for the extremely
preterm infants and the upper limits (i.e. 60% and 90%) for the very preterm infants. This
is generated in Matlab (version
R2013b, [The Mathworks](http://www.mathworks.co.uk/products/matlab/)).  See file
for [outcome\_hypoxia\_hyperoxia.m](outcome_hypoxia_hyperoxia.m) for more details.  Run in
Matlab as


```matlab
%% generate placeholder data (colour Gaussian noise for rcSO2) for 120 babies:
all_data=gen_random_NIRS_data(120);

%% estimate area above/below thresholds and compare between the 3 outcome groups:
outcome_hypoxia_hyperoxia(all_data);
```

Above function assumes that the array-structure `all_data` is of the form:

field name | explanation
------------ | -------------
baby\_ID | string for baby identifier 
DOB\_time | time and date of birth (e.g. '14-Sep-2015 01:16:00')
GA | gestational age (in days)
outcome | either 1 = normal; 2 = mild; 3 = moderate/severe
nirs\_time | time (vector) for rcSO2 (in seconds)
nirs\_data | rcSO2 (vector)
